## My AI Usage

Throughout the development of this project, I leveraged AI tools to enhance productivity and code quality while maintaining full understanding and control over the implementation.

### Tools Used

**Claude (Anthropic)**
I used Claude primarily for architectural planning and code structure guidance. When starting the project, I discussed the overall system design and got suggestions for organizing the Spring Boot application structure. Claude helped me think through the database schema design and recommended best practices for implementing JWT authentication with Spring Security.

**ChatGPT**
I utilized ChatGPT for specific coding challenges and debugging assistance. When I encountered issues with CORS configuration between React and Spring Boot, ChatGPT helped me identify the correct Spring Security configuration. I also used it to generate initial test case structures, which I then customized for my specific business logic requirements.

### How AI Enhanced My Development Process

**Project Structure and Setup**
AI tools helped me quickly establish the proper project structure for both Spring Boot and React applications. Rather than spending time researching directory organization, I got immediate suggestions that I could evaluate and implement.

**Problem Solving**
When I encountered specific technical challenges, particularly with Spring Security configuration and React state management, AI provided multiple solution approaches. This allowed me to compare different strategies and choose the most appropriate one for my use case.

**Code Quality Improvement**
I used AI to review my code patterns and suggest improvements for error handling, validation logic, and REST API design. The suggestions often included edge cases I hadn't initially considered.

**Testing Strategy**
AI assistance was valuable in understanding testing patterns for Spring Boot applications, particularly around MockMvc usage and integration testing setup.

### My Approach to AI Collaboration

I maintained a collaborative approach with AI tools rather than relying on them for direct code generation. I would typically:

1. Present my current implementation or challenge
2. Discuss different approaches with the AI
3. Ask for specific guidance on best practices
4. Implement the solution myself, incorporating the insights gained
5. Iterate and refine based on my understanding

This approach ensured that I fully understood every piece of code in the project while benefiting from AI's knowledge of best practices and common patterns.

### Impact on Learning and Development

Using AI tools enhanced my learning experience by exposing me to different coding patterns and architectural approaches I might not have discovered otherwise. The interactive nature of discussing problems with AI helped me think through challenges more systematically and consider edge cases earlier in the development process.
